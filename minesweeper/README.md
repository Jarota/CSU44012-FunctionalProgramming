# Minesweeper in Haskell

Top left square is (0,0), bottom right is (r-1, c-1).

Demo parameters:
- 10 rows, 10 columns, and 10 bombs.
- Clear row 0, column 0, and then 'auto move' your way to victory.

TODO
- Implement clicking on squares.
- Place bombs *more* randomly.
- Add more advanced techniques to the Bot.
